Problem Description

You are given two non-negative integers A and B, find the value of Least Common Multiple (LCM) of A and B.

LCM of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both.



Problem Constraints

1 <= A, B <= 1000



Input Format

First argument is an integer A.

Second argument is an integer B.



Output Format

Return an integer.



Example Input

Input 1:

 A = 2
 B = 3 
Input 2:

 A = 9
 B = 6
Input 3:

 A = 2
 B = 6


Example Output

Output 1:

 6 
Input 2:

 18 
Input 3:

 6 


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

 6 is the smallest positive integer which is divisible by both 2 (2 * 3 = 6) and 3 (3 * 2 = 6).
Explanation 2:

 18 is the smallest positive integer which is divisible by both 9 (9 * 2 = 18) and 6 (6 * 3 = 18).
Explanation 3:

 6 is the smallest positive integer which is divisible by both 2 (2 * 3 = 6) and 6 (6 * 1 = 6).

        * Approach 1:
        *   List the first several multiples of 

            20: 20,40,60,80,100,120,140,160
            15: 15,30,45,60,75,90,105,12020: 20,40,60,80,100,120,140,160
            The smallest number to appear on both lists is 60
            so 60 is the least common multiple of 15 and 20

            Notice that 
            120 is on both lists, too. It is a common multiple, but it is not
            the least common multiple.

            int ans2 = B;
            while(true){

                    return ans1;

                    if(ans1 > ans2)
                        ans2 = ans2 + B;

        *   GCD of two numbers always exists between 1 and minimum among the two numbers. 
            So we can iterate through all the numbers through 1 to min(A, B) and find the 
            largest number G such that both A and B are divisible by it.
            Then, LCM = (A * B) / G.

            # TC = O(A or B) whichever is minimum || SC = O(1)
