Problem Description

Given two binary strings, return their sum (also a binary string).
Example:

a = "100"

b = "11"
Return a + b = "111".



//Soln - java 8

public class Solution {
    public String addBinary(String A, String B) {
        //Approach :-
        //Create a stringbuilder to store the answer or result
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        //Two variables to store the carry values after addition and reminder after division
        int carry = 0, rem = 0;
        //In the first loop we will iterate over both the list in backword manner
        int i = A.length()-1, j = B.length()-1;
        while(i >= 0 && j >= 0){
            //Get sum of last characters of string and carry store it in sum
            //Note :- charAt() method returns aschii values so substract it with zero to 
            //get actual value
            int sum = (int)(A.charAt(i)-'0') + (int)(B.charAt(j)-'0') + carry;
            //Take reminder by doing Mod 2 as it is a binary string
            rem = sum % 2;
            //Append it ti stringbuilder
            sb.append(rem);
            //Check if we get an carry for next addition by doing sun / 2
            carry = sum / 2;
            //decrement i and j
            i--;
            j--;
        }

        //If both strings are not of same length then we will remain with some char left for
        //that againg check if i or j greater than or equal to 0 if not than again do same
        //process as above
        if(i >= 0){
            while(i >= 0){
                int sum = (int)(A.charAt(i)-'0') + carry;
                rem = sum % 2;
                sb.append(rem);
                carry = sum / 2;
                i--;
            }
        }

        if(j >= 0){
            while(j >= 0){
                int sum = (int)(B.charAt(j)-'0') + carry;
                rem = sum % 2;
                sb.append(rem);
                carry = sum / 2;
                j--;
            }
        }

        //In the last check where carry is greater than 0 or not 
        //if yes than append carray to stringbuilder
        if(carry > 0){
                sb.append(carry);
        }
        //Finally reverse the stringbuilder and return the answer in string format
        return sb.reverse().toString();

        //TC = O(N) || SC = O(N)
    }
