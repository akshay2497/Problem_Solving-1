Problem Description

Given a string A of size N consisting of lowercase alphabets.

You can change at most B characters in the given string to any other lowercase alphabet such that the number of distinct characters in the string is minimized.

Find the minimum number of distinct characters in the resulting string.



Problem Constraints

1 <= N <= 100000

0 <= B < N



Input Format

First argument is a string A.

Second argument is an integer B.



Output Format

Return an integer denoting the minimum number of distinct characters in the string.



Example Input

A = "abcabbccd"
B = 3



Example Output

2



Example Explanation

We can change both 'a' and one 'd' into 'b'.So the new string becomes "bbcbbbccb".
So the minimum number of distinct character will be 2.


//Java - 8

public class Solution {
    public int solve(String A, int B) {
        /*
        Since there are 26 characters we can find frequency of each character.
        Sort them in ascending order. Since we have to minimize number of distinct character, 
        we will change character whose frequency is less into the character which have highest 
        frequency.
        We will check maximum number of distinct characters we can successfully change.
        */
        //Creating array of 26 int ele
        int[] arr = new int[26];
        //Storing frequency
        for(int i = 0; i < A.length(); i++){
            arr[A.charAt(i) - 'a']++;
        }
        //Sorting array in ascending order
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        int i;
        //Removing cheracters with lower occurances
        for(i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
            //Check if we substract current ele(i.e. No of occurances of a char) from B it 
            //Should be greater than 0 or else break
            if(B-arr[i] >= 0){
                B = B-arr[i];
            }else{
                break;
            }
        }

        //Now as we know we have 26 char in alpha series and we traversed till i in prev for loop
        //So we have 26 - i distinct char left in the string 
        //i.e. if i == 24 then answer is 26 - i == 26 - 24 == 2
        return 26-i;
    }
}
