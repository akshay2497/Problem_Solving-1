Hi Visitor,

As a Software Engineer, I am a problem solver and a lifelong learner by heart. Being able to combine both passions makes the job meaningful and very exciting for me. Engineering professional with 0.8 years of industry experience who is hands-on at Product Development, Distributed Architecture and Systems, Scalable Enterprise Applications. Background in computer science, with a focus on problem-solving(Data structures and Algorithms) skills, System Designs the Ability to learn coding languages and platforms as needed 

I am part of the Cybages InMoment eSaaS development team at present and have been working on some large-scale features, services throughout the complete software development life cycle. As a software engineer I have experience with general programming with OOP's languages like Java and C# and front end technologies like Javascript, Angular, React.

I am still enthusiastically seizing onto any problem-solving pattern, programming languages, frameworks, and principles which I can integrate into the coding world in my head. After all this, usually when I am not working or learning I line up with a circle of acquaintances to spend time with.
